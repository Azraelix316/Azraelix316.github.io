Practice Essay","icon":"","description":"TWE did the people/government lead to social change?Step 1: Analysis, find angles\n\"Social change\" I would immediately ask if it's political or economic or both. Assuming it's both, what I would then find what the TWE is - in this case, I'm assuming the spectrum is the people vs. the government\nSo my evidence is arguing the specific questions:\nTo what extent did the people vs. the government lead to political and economic change? Step 2: Planning\nNow that I know the actual EQ:\nI would then break it down into three themes\nI want these themes to be political and economic and I need a counter, and preferably one which is much stronger\nI would put some key concepts/umbrella terms with basic weighting\nEconomic policies? ()\nCentralized planning? ()\nDemocraticization? (very strong for people)\necon growth? (strong for govt)\nSuppression? (strong for govt)\nThen, I chose the themes (democratization as counter, econ growth, centralized planning)\nand chose E.VWarning\nRemember that you need E.V from both China and Taiwan in each paragraph!\nWild Lily Movement\nTiananmen square - lack of social change\nCultural RevolutionKaohsiung Export Processing Zone\n1st 5-year plan\nS.O.EStep 3: thesis1st Draft:\nWhile the social changes of democratization brought by the people were significantly important, social changes were overall brought mainly by the government: two major factors include centralized planning providing an overall direction for countries and economic policies that led to growth.2nd Draft:\nI realized I do NOT want to write about centralized planning, as I'm stronger on the economic side. Tip\nSince you always want to write about counter, place the counter first and place something like \"While\" conjunctions at the start for thesis structure or just use \"however\"\nWhile the social changes of democratization brought by the people were of moderate importance, they were outweighed by the significantly important changes brought by economic policies and centralized planning of the government - overall, social changes were significantly influence by the government.Info\nRemember to do all the thesis-y things\nWrite TWE weigh E.V etc. etc.\nStep 3.5 CATS:\nIn a CATS, you weigh the theme in relation to other themes not to the overall thesis itself.The social changes of democratization were a major factor to why social changes were significantly influenced by the government and not completely influenced by the government.Social changes brought by economic policies are a highly significant factor to why the government significantly influenced social changes.Step 4: Write!The social changes of democratization were a major factor to why social changes were significantly influenced by the government and not completely influenced by the government.\nOne of the examples of successful democratization is the Wild Lily movement in 1990, a student led movement triggered by the funeral of the self-immolation of a journalist in Taiwan that demanded faster steps to democracy. The Wild Lily movement was successful and forced Lee Teng Hui to accept their demands, such as dissolving the national assembly and providing a timetable for clear steps towards a true democracy. The Wild Lily Movement shows how large, mass movements of people can place pressure on the government and demand social change towards democratization. Democratization is one of the most significant social changes inside a nation, a complete change of political structure. This is relevant because the Wild Lily movement shows how the people directly contribute towards democratization and thus social change - the people led this movement solely of their own volition, which shows how the government sometimes does not have full control of social changes.\nHowever, suppression of people's movements also exists. One of the most extreme cases was the Tiananmen Square Incident in China in 1989, where over 300 civilians were shot down by the CCP military forces trying to clear Tiananmen square, filled with 2 million people. Afterwards, the CCP tightened censorship and prevented further steps towards democratization. Tiananmen square was the turning point for China, and the actions that the CCP prevented more people's movements in the future. As such, in China there has not been much social change since that period - there have no further mass demonstrations due to the prevention of people's movements. This is relevant because it shows us how when the people are unable to gather and unable to demonstrate, social changes are much more difficult to create. While the government can suppress and prevent changes, many actual social changes result from the people.\nFurthermore, the Cultural Revolution is another example of how social changes must result from the people's actions. In the 1960s, Mao had lost power and needed to reclaim his status in the CCP. To do so, he created the four olds (old habits, customs, ideas, and structures) and utilized propaganda in order to create the Red Guards, his main troops during the Cultural Revolution. Mainly students, they idolized Mao and created chaos through China. The Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards show how even political leaders need people in order to change political structures. Mao needed to have actual people to rise back to the top of the CCP and put pressure on reformists to put him back in power. The Red Guards show how powerful people acting in large masses can be and how much change they can create - many intellectuals left China and China's reforms were mostly removed and reverted to Maoist/communist ideals. This is relevant because it shows how social change is physically executed by people. While Mao manipulated the people, the Cultural Revolution shows how governments and political leaders alone cannot create cultural change, as culture is controlled by the people's ideas. Only by manipulating the people can they truly create social change.Social changes brought by economic policies are a highly significant factor to why the government significantly influenced social changes. While the government alone cannot create cultural change, they can create economic policies that lead to economic change and improve living conditions, such as in the case of Taiwan's Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone. The government created an export processing zone that was solely for export, and had incentives for foreign investors. This caused the U.S and Japan to outsource their work to Taiwan, and significantly improved Taiwan's economy leading to the development of \"Taiwan's Economic Miracle\" where Taiwan was the fastest growing economy for 2 decades. The S.E.Z shows us how the government can contribute heavily to economic growth and improve living conditions for its population. The government was solely responsible for the creation of the economic zone and the incentives that allowed for so many factories and businesses to prosper, which shows us how economic growth in Taiwan was triggered by the government's actions. As such, many of the improvements and changes to living conditions were caused by the Taiwanese government. Furthermore, governments can also completely control the economy, such as with the 5-year plans first instituted in China in 1952. The 1st 5-year plan led to many quantifiable improvements - coal production went from 65 million tons to 130 million tons a year, steel and iron production tripled, and railways increased significantly. The second 5-yea plan had goals set too high and led to mass starvation in China. The 5-year plans show us how governments have immense control over their economic policies which have a massive effect on the population. While the 1st 5-year plan led to many improvements for the people of China, the Great Leap Forward was unsuccessful and killed millions. The 5-year plans show how governments have great control over the living conditions of their population via economic policies. Living conditions, an example of social changes, can be greatly influenced by the government for better or for worse.\nAnother example of the influence of governments on social changes and economic policies is Deng's conversion of China from a communist country to one of \"socialism with Chinese Characteristics\", or a market-based country. Deng's conversion of China to a more capitalist economy shows how economic policies by governments can alter the identity of a country - a key part of the identity of a country is its economic structure and ideology. Deng's conversion of China's economic structure is relevant because it shows how governments can control a countries' identity. Economic changes brought by governments can create massive social changes such as converting the entire economic structure of a nation.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"History Practice Essay","level":1,"id":"History Practice Essay"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"archive/history-of-asia/history-practice-essay.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1748316346428,"modifiedTime":1748320227863,"sourceSize":8836,"sourcePath":"ARCHIVE/History of Asia/History Practice Essay.md","exportPath":"archive/history-of-asia/history-practice-essay.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"archive/history-of-asia/household-responsibility-system.html":{"title":"Household Responsibility System","icon":"","description":"Tags: <a href=\".?query=tag:history\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#history\">#history</a>\nDate of writing: 2025-05-27<br>The Household Responsibility System was similar to the original <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Communes and Collectives\" data-href=\"Communes and Collectives\" href=\"archive/history-of-asia/communes-and-collectives.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Collectives</a>, where farmers could sell their surplus - this was one of <a data-href=\"Deng's Economic Reforms\" href=\"archive/history-of-asia/deng's-economic-reforms.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Deng's Economic Reforms</a> and led to a 10% increase in agriculture yearly, being adapted by most farmers throughout China.

Then, run the WPIlib Installer. You may need to run as administrator or unblock it via \"Properties\" if Windows Defender \"protects\" your computer. Then, follow the instructions in the installer, but make sure to install VS code along with the rest of the tools. The installer will extract and help download the rest of the files.\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to find and run WPIlib VS Code 2025, which is the IDE you'll be using.

You make some edits, make a snapshot (a commit) of your code, so when you realize you made a massive mistake, you can revert and go back to that version.\nAnother benefit of Git is the ability to make branches - you can branch off of stable working code, add and test a new feature, then merge it back into the stable branch. This is incredibly useful when working on a big project with multiple people: you can independently work on separate features.\nHowever, Git by itself is only for local use, to share and work online, you need to use GitHub to put your git workspace online.

You can access all commands using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P, but if you only want to see WPIlib based commands you can click the WPIlib logo This brings up a list of commands - the most important ones are build robot code and deploy robot code. Building the code checks it for errors, and deploying the code deploys it to the robot.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250612111221.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250612111221.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIn the sidebar, there's also a WPIlib logo, and when you click it it shows the vendor dependencies. Vendor dependencies (vendordeps) are used to add additional function on top of default WPIlib function, such as CTRE Phoenix's libraries, which add motion magic (motion profiles).\nGo into the command palette and create a new project. When you get to the project creation screen, select the template option, then java, then \"Command Robot Skeleton (Advanced)\". This gives you a virtually blank slate to start from.\nFollow the rest of the directions (team number for R1 is 8503) to make the project!<br>\nNow, you're ready to move into <a data-href=\"Git and Github\" href=\"to-code-a-robot/working-in-a-team/git-and-github.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Git and Github</a> and start doing actual hands-on work.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":["#frc","#coding","#to-code-a-robot"],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Navigating the IDE","level":1,"id":"Navigating the IDE"},{"heading":"Command Palette","level":2,"id":"Command_Palette"},{"heading":"Creating your first project","level":2,"id":"Creating_your_first_project"}],"links":["?query=tag:frc","?query=tag:coding","?query=tag:to-code-a-robot","to-code-a-robot/getting-started/navigating-the-ide.html#image-cedd8c70c140a08a82376b2cbdd2d17092a6af9a","to-code-a-robot/working-in-a-team/git-and-github.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"to-code-a-robot/getting-started/navigating-the-ide.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["pasted-image-20250612111221.html"],"createdTime":1749697166050,"modifiedTime":1749786756924,"sourceSize":1804,"sourcePath":"To-Code-a-Robot/Getting Started/Navigating the IDE.md","exportPath":"to-code-a-robot/getting-started/navigating-the-ide.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"to-code-a-robot/programming-basics/programming-basics.html":{"title":"Programming Basics","icon":"","description":"Tags: <a href=\".?query=tag:frc\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#frc\">#frc</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:coding\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#coding\">#coding</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:to-code-a-robot\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#to-code-a-robot\">#to-code-a-robot</a>\nDate: 2025-06-12By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...<br><a data-href=\"Basic Programming I - Variables &amp;

Main is only for working, tested code. That's why you should branch off of main to test specific features. It also helps to keep others' broken code (and also your broken code) from messing up other people's code.<br>\nSo, now that you now why we branch, make a branch yourself with your name using the git branch command (or again, you can use the GUI/command palette). Then inside your new branch, create a new blank template project. (see <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Navigating the IDE > Creating your first project\" data-href=\"Navigating the IDE#Creating your first project\" href=\"to-code-a-robot/getting-started/navigating-the-ide.html#Creating_your_first_project\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Creating your first project</a>). This is now your branch, and it's where you'll be doing all your work.\nNow that you have your own branch, you might be wondering how we actually merge back into main. Merging is something you'll have to do a lot of, and you can do this via the git merge command. By merging, you'll create a new commit, and that commit will have two branches' code together.<br>However, you might have merge conflicts, which you MUST always resolve. Merge conflicts are pretty simple - you go through each file that has a conflict and select the code segment you want to keep. It's too hard to explain it in writing so here's a video tutorial: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz5OuKzvadQ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz5OuKzvadQ\" target=\"_self\">Video tutorial</a>\nUsually, you should use the three-way editor which is a lot faster and simpler to use.\nIt's a little hard to test for merge conflicts in a general sense, so I'll go through and make some manually when you start working on more complicated code.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":["#frc","#coding","#to-code-a-robot"],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Branches","level":1,"id":"Branches"},{"heading":"Why Branch?","level":3,"id":"Why_Branch?"},{"heading":"Merging Branches","level":3,"id":"Merging_Branches"}],"links":["?query=tag:frc","?query=tag:coding","?query=tag:to-code-a-robot","to-code-a-robot/getting-started/navigating-the-ide.html#Creating_your_first_project"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"to-code-a-robot/working-in-a-team/branches.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749715639413,"modifiedTime":1749822123494,"sourceSize":1655,"sourcePath":"To-Code-a-Robot/Working in a Team/Branches.md","exportPath":"to-code-a-robot/working-in-a-team/branches.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"to-code-a-robot/working-in-a-team/git-commands.html":{"title":"Git Commands","icon":"","description":"Tags: <a href=\".?query=tag:frc\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#frc\">#frc</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:coding\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#coding\">#coding</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:to-code-a-robot\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#to-code-a-robot\">#to-code-a-robot</a>\nDate: 2025-06-12Sometimes, you might find it easier to use the terminal rather than any GUI (graphical interface) to do Git work - some commands can only be done in the terminal!\nOpen up a terminal within VScode via Ctrl + ` (backtick) or via the command palette.\nYou may find it useful to change your terminal to Git Bash instead of Powershell for some commands.\nFirst things first: configure git via the Git Config command inside the terminal<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration\" target=\"_self\">(See here)</a> Make sure to set it to the same username and email you use for GitHub!\nBy configuring git, you tell git/github who you are, and what email address/user name to sign commits with.\nThe first step to starting work is to clone (copy) the repository you want to work with. <br>You could probably create the repo first and push it online for local projects, but since the training repository already exists, use git clone on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/TASRobotics/RaidOne-2026-Offseason\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/TASRobotics/RaidOne-2026-Offseason\" target=\"_self\">training repo</a>.

The commit message should be in imperative tense: \"If this commit is applied, it will ...\"\nAlso, make small commits so you can revert to more specific changes.\nWhile it seems really nitpicky to use imperative tense, when you're going through 600 commits you really want to be able to identify what specific changes you made instead of only being able to see \"change some smol speed sturff\". Some programmers have really bad habits and debugging their code sucks because of it.\nNow, you after you've made a commit, your job isn't done yet! You now have to push it online so others can see it. You can either click the sync button, or within terminal run git push to push your changes online. Something else to note is that Git doesn't automatically pull changes either - if someone made some changes, you'll have to sync or use git pull first.You can also push your changes online during the

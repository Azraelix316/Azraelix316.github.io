2025-05-05Martial law was enacted in Taiwan after the KMT arrival in order for the KMT to remain control, also known as the \"White Terror\", it was the second longest period of martial law in global history (second to Syria). However, it was decorated with massacres and protests and eventually the KMT lifted martial law in 1987.\nOverall: (B), mediocre, you could argue it but better pieces of evidence out there What role did political leaders play in the changes in their country? (B) The period of martial law serves as a way to show how CKS was extremely powerful and able to hold control over Taiwan But, it's probably better to point to Mao and the CCP's ironclad control, much stronger How did people contribute to political changes in their country?

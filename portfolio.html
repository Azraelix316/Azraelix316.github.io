            <h1>VEX Over Under</h1>
            <p>In the VEX season 2023-24, Over Under, as the middle school team 4813B we managed to get a high enough
                skills ranking at nationals in order to qualify for the world championships that year.
                As the programmer, I contributed to the autonomous portion of the robot, as well as the driver control,
                especially autonomous skills which helped us get the world championships. VEX taught me a lot about basic control systems and coding for robotics and real-world systems, and really helped me develop my passion for robotics and started my journey into C++.

            <p>Designed and created a minimax model to optimize a tax on tourism in Juneau, Alaska, for problem B of the
                Mathematical Competition in Modeling, an undergraduate and high school competition.
                I participated in a team of 3 freshmen, and we won the Honorable Mention award for our solution (top
                ~31% of all teams).
                The model was created in C++ and the final 24-page paper was written in LaTeX, all in under 3 days.
                During this experience, I developed my C++ skills and my mathematical modeling ability.

                Event.
                As the programmer, I developed a reliable and high-scoring autonomous that allowed us to picked by a
                strong alliance that allowed us to win the event.

            <p>
                In the FRC season 2025, Reefscape, competing with 8503 (Raid One) we managed to qualify for the World Championships for the first time in 8503's history. During this time, I mainly worked on mechatronics, coding and refactoring most of the subsystems. Due to my prior experience, I worked on a variety of projects, such as migrating the codebase to use the 2025 versions of all libraries, as well as working on creating code and commands for all subsystems.
                FRC really helped me develop my skill in working with a team.

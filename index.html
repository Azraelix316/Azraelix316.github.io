        <p>
          In the FRC season 2025, Reefscape, competing with 8503 (Raid One) we managed to qualify for the World
          Championships for the first time in 8503's history. During this time, I mainly worked on mechatronics, coding
          and refactoring most of the subsystems. Due to my prior experience, I worked on a variety of projects, such as
          migrating the codebase to use the 2025 versions of all libraries, as well as working on creating code and
          commands for all subsystems.
          FRC really helped me develop my skill in working with a team.

        <p>
          p5.js, an artistic js library, was the first "language" I learned, as it's syntax is completely different.
          Over the years, I've created many projects of generative art with p5.js, many of which have also improved my
          mathematical skills as well, as well as my skills for design.

        <h1>Math Modeling</h1>
        <p>
          For math modeling, I did a lot of work with C++, especially low level C++, to optimize algorithms. I created
          a
          library, DSCILIB, currently still a WIP but with many helpful helper functions in order to help make coding
          more efficient - I learned some more advanced mathematics in linear algebra such as PCA and also transition
          matrices specifically for this library, which I used to help accelerate my workflow during the HiMCM 2025
          competition. It's still a work in progress, but I used many of the matrix based helper functions and QoL,
          and
          hopefully it will develop to become a core library.
          The actual usage of this library was for the MCM/HiMCM math modeling competitions, where much of the work
          was
          creating simulations to accumulate data that could be used.

        <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
        <p>
          A short foray into web design, I went through a lot of iterations and really developed my artistic design
          skills and my coding skills. Using minimal JS, I mainly focused on developing my HTML and CSS skills, and
          ended up learning a lot about how to work with minimal UX/UI elements and frontend development. I also
          utilized my past p5.js projects to provide some basic animations and backgrounds, to make the website more
          visually diverse. The things I'm most proud of on this website are the UX for the menu, which I happened to
          somehow create, and also the implementation of p5.js as well - now, I can integrate p5.js into actual web
          applications and this really brought me into JS for it's true purpose of web development.

        <p>
          For the class Honors Modern Topics in Computer Science, I learned a lot about quantum computing and quantum
          algorithms. The two biggest projects I undertook in this class were implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa and
          Simon's
          Algorithms, using Qiskit in Python. While much of the coding process was done with AI assistance, the real
          learning came with learning the mathematical aspects and computations.
